ITEP 1.2

This release includes a number of new features and bug fixes.

NEW FEATURES:
- OrthoMCL wrapper now optionally takes as input an arbitrary table of BLAST results from the ITEP database.
- makeCoreClusterAnalysisTree.py now optionally can be used to analyze presence-absence patterns relative to sister clades,
  rather than relative to all organisms in the cluster run. See help text for details.

BUG FIXES:
- Check for biopython version no longer fails due to letters in the version number. Thanks to Matt Richards for reporting.
- Fix handling of version numbers when number provided in convertGenbankToTable does not match the number in the provided Genbank file.
  Thanks to Matt Richards for reporting.
- Fixed handling of sanitized gene IDs (e.g. fig_83333_1_peg_1 intead of fig|83333.1.peg.1) when displaying trees
- Fixed handling of tBLASTn IDs when building gene neighborhood trees

OTHER CHANGES:
- unsanitizeGeneId() function moved to sanitizeString.py library to avoid importing many tree-related libraries when not necessary.
